    <h2>Places to Visit</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Leh</li>
      <p>
        The Ladakh capital city of Leh lies near the eastern parts of Jammu and
        Kashmir, on the crossroads of the historic "Silk Route" from Sinkiang to
        West Asia and to the plains of India. The humbling monasteries of Shey,
        Hemis, Alchi, Thikse and Lamayuru will nurture your spiritual needs, and
        the landscape of Leh provides for a number of adventure activities
        including mountaineering, white-water rafting and trekking along the
        Markha Valley.
      </p>
      <li>Ladakh</li>
      <p>
        The landscape of Ladhak, a high altitude desert, is defined by craggy,
        barren cliffs and plateaus. Ladhak is a favourite among adventure sports
        enthusiasts, offering unique adventures in trekking, mountaineering and
        white water rafting. While rafting options are available on both Indus
        and Zanskar rivers, the Zanskar course is more difficult and exciting.
        The trekking options range from short, day-long walks to visit monuments
        or monastic settlements to long, trans-mountain treks involving weeks of
        walking and camping in the wilderness. Ladhak celebrates a numbers of
        monastic festivals - annual events of the major monasteries primarily in
        winters. The month of September, hosts the Ladhak Festival, that gives a
        peek into the richness, depth and pageantry of Ladakh's centuries-old
        culture, traditions and folk heritage. One can witness the best samples
        of the region's performing arts, Archery contests and the Ladhak Polo
        Cup.
      </p>
      <li>Srinagar</li>
      <p>
        Srinigar is a modern waterworld, dominated by Dal Lake and its twisting
        waterways, tree-lined Nagin Lake, and the Jhelum River. Engulf yourself
        in local culture by embracing your sea legs and renting one of the
        wooden boats called shikaras for a daytime or twilight cruise. On land,
        stroll through the terraced hillsides of the 400-year-old Mughal
        Gardens, created by Emperor Jehangir for his wife, and shop for
        indigenous crafts like hand-woven silks and embroidered shawls.
      </p>
      <li>Jaipur</li>
      <p>
        If you take one look at the glorious stucco buildings that line Jaipur's
        wide streets, you'll understand why this is nicknamed "The Pink City."
        Spend your days exploring City Palace, Hawa Mahal, and Amber and Jaigarh
        forts. And if you're looking for a unique souvenir, head to one of the
        bazaars, where you can pick up a pair of camel-leather slippers.
      </p>
      <li>Swaminarayan Akshardham, New Delhi</li>
      <p>
        Fantastic site to visit - unimaginable architechture, great theme show,
        diaorama and I max presentation. If any tourist, irresepctive of his
        religion or creed, has half a day to spare, this is a must see. It is
        one man's creation in five years totally with voluntary support. A
        monument which makes every indian proud!
